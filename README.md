# Pedro's TEC repository

## DISCLAIMER
The content of this repository is being published for the sake of storing my code and helping people with samples. If you want to copy homework from here (I hope you won't, this is pretty *low* :( ), I suggest thinking twice, because samples here aren't in their best readable way (Until last year I started doing clean code as a must) and in a throughout revision, you will have a sword in your neck for not understanding what this piece of code you copied is doing (believe me).

If you are a teacher and is against this repo or a certain project (even though the solution here is to get creative with new projects instead of relaunching them in the next semester), please contact me at *perodriguez@ic-itcr.ac.cr*. I will answer your email and talk with you about it. 

## FOR TEX FILES
I have compiled TEX files using Sublime Text with LaTeXTools
